Fault location estimation along a transmission line
Three algorithms have been tested
1) Impedance-based FLA that uses the sequence componenets of fault currents and voltages
2) Traveling-wave based FLA that uses DWT to processs the current signals coming form the end terminals
3) Artificial Neural Network based FLA that estimates the fault location. The input and target values have been eclosed in the repository
